# Terms of Service & Spatial Safety Agreement
**Last Updated: July 2026**

Welcome to **MindSpark**. Please read these legally binding contract terms, monetization rules, and cloud streaming requirements carefully before initializing your first hardware simulation cycle.

## 1. Age Requirement & Parental Guardianship (13+)
By initializing MindSpark, you represent and warrant that you are **at least 13 years of age**. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you must review this agreement with a parent or legal guardian to ensure full compliance and physical safety tracking.

## 2. Cloud Server Infrastructure & Camera Data Flows
MindSpark utilizes secure cloud server infrastructures running isolated remote computing instances to calculate and stream high-fidelity vector layouts scaling up to **6 feet (1.8 meters) in height**.
* **Device Camera Access:** To accurately position and visualize large-scale 3D models, the application requires real-time access to your device's camera hardware.
* **Encrypted Data in Transit:** Tracking telemetry, video frame spatial coordinates, and vector matrices are compressed and piped over secure, encrypted network connections (SSL/TLS WebRTC data channels) to your dedicated cloud computing environment.
* **Ephemeral Memory Architecture:** This remote rendering pipeline processes your hardware spatial data in absolute runtime isolation. No raw video footage, personal camera streams, or biometric indicators are permanently saved, cached, or written to persistent disk storage. When your session closes, the temporary memory within the cloud instance is completely destroyed.
* **Network Constraints:** Because the hologram calculation occurs on remote GPUs, rendering fluidity, latency, and visual stability are entirely dependent on your internet connection speed (high-speed Wi-Fi or 5G recommended).

## 3. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) Compliance
MindSpark strictly adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) guidelines governing users under the age of 13:
* **No Biometric Identification Retention:** Although the app analyzes your device camera to calculate spatial surfaces and track vector meshes locally, no structural facial templates, unique tracking maps, or voice footprints are sent to, stored on, or shared with cloud environments.
* **Granular Third-Party AI Consent:** Text tokens and query payloads sent to external cognitive services (such as Google Gemini and Groq) are stripped of all personal names, emails, and student IDs. 
* **Zero Targeted Advertising for Minors:** In compliance with COPPA rules, users identified as minors are entirely isolated from behavioral tracking systems and are only served contextually generic, non-targeted educational advertisements.
* **Parental Erasure Rights:** Parents retain the absolute right to inspect any educational performance metadata recorded in our database, request immediate erasure, or revoke data access permissions.

## 4. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Data Subject Rights
For users residing within the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), all pipeline interactions are governed by the strict tenets of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
* **Lawful Basis for Processing:** Spatial tracking and camera telemetry data are processed based on your **Explicit Affirmative Consent** (Article 6(1)(a)). Cloud AI tutoring logs are processed under the basis of **Contractual Necessity** (Article 6(1)(b)).
* **Data Minimization & Storage Limitation:** Transmitted video frame metrics are treated as ephemeral data, held strictly within temporary cloud RAM during the rendering cycle, and permanently deleted immediately upon session termination.
* **Cross-Border Transfers:** Cloud processing tasks routing outside the EEA to third-party endpoints leverage hardened **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** and active Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with infrastructure providers.
* **Your Rights:** You maintain the absolute Right to Access, Right to Rectification, Right to Object, and the Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten). You can execute these data cleansing commands instantly by purging your profile dataset within your account options dashboard.

## 5. Large-Scale Projection & Boundary Safety ⚠️
* **Clearance Radius:** You must maintain a minimum clear physical radius of **8 feet (2.5 meters)** completely free of obstacles, pets, walls, furniture, or tripping hazards before rendering full-scale components.
* **Environmental Prohibitions:** Never operate the spatial tracking engine near stairways, balconies, public roadways, pools, active construction zones, or unstable ground infrastructures.
* **Situational Awareness:** Do not step backward while focusing on the digital asset through the screen. Users assume all risk associated with their physical movement during spatial projection sessions.

## 6. Monetization & Advertising Disclosures
This application integrates advertising services to provide free access to educational tools.
* **Data Collection:** The advertising module may automatically access anonymous device identifiers to deliver compliant contextual promotions.
* **Student Protections:** All advertising targets are explicitly filtered to block sensitive categories, ensuring absolute safety for general student populations.

## 7. Service Termination & Security Protections
We reserve the absolute right to terminate, throttle, or permanently block access to the application and its cloud nodes without prior notice if:
* Your device attempts to execute malicious packet injections, socket manipulation, or reverse-engineering scripts against our custom endpoints.
* Your account bypasses our security filters to extract or exploit underlying database models.

## 8. Limitation of Liability
The developers, publishers, and distributors of MindSpark accept **zero legal or financial liability** for any physical injury, personal property damage, hardware degradation, data overages, network downtime, or legal disputes resulting from improper real-world application operation, lack of spatial environmental awareness, or failure to clear physical boundaries.
